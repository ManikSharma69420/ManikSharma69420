Either way, if you enjoy waht you see, give it a download and maybe me a follow?

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on Python stuff with Pygame rn and my website and Godot and Arduino stuff (lol)

- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Godot and C/C++

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! Related to my repos or not! I'm happy to have a simple chat! Family friendly, though!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact me on this email : manik.manu@hotmail.com (yes i know its cringe) and ask me anything!

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

- âš¡ Fun fact: I use VSCode, Visual Studio, Arduino IDE, Node.js, Godot, Sublime Text and believe it or not, Notepad! (rarely though lol) I also ADORE the font Cascadia Code by Microsoft (you probably guessed that if you visited my website or used my SimplTextEditor lol)
